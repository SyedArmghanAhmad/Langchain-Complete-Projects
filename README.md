# LangChain Basics

This repository contains fundamental implementations of **LangChain**, demonstrating its core functionalities with practical examples. It includes notebooks covering essential LangChain concepts, chatbot development, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.

## 📌 Features
- **Basic LangChain Concepts:** A Jupyter notebook implementing key functionalities of LangChain.
- **Chatbot with Mixtral (Groq):** A simple chatbot powered by the Mixtral model via Groq.
- **Simple RAG Pipeline:** Basic retrieval-augmented generation implementation.
- **Advanced RAG Q&A Chatbot:** A more sophisticated RAG-based chatbot for answering questions from documents.

## 🔧 Installation
To run these notebooks locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyedArmghanAhmad/Langchain-basics.git
   cd Langchain-basics
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
Run Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open any notebook to explore LangChain implementations.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- LangChain
- Groq API (for Mixtral chatbot)
- FAISS (for RAG pipelines)
- OpenAI API (if applicable)

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Implement different embedding models (e.g., Hugging Face, Ollama)
- Add vector database integrations (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB)
- Optimize advanced RAG pipeline for better performance
